It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

SAMUEL is a remarkably talented upcoming actor. One morning, Samuel is offered the opportunity of his lifetime: The lead role in a studio film. While celebrating, Samuel dares his best friend to a swimming contest in the ocean. Drunk and overpowered by waves, Samuel is pushed against the pylons of the Santa Monica Pier and suffers a concussion. As Samuel drowns, Leah jumps into the water and rescues him. One month later, Leah is unable to take a shower. She has developed a fear of water that is gradually taking over her life. Samuel is forced to put his acting career on hold as he struggles to cope with his inability to focus and with short-term memory problems as a consequence of the accident. Angry and deeply frustrated, Samuel decides to contact Leah, but not to thank her. When Leah and Samuel meet again, there is an immediate, almost supernatural rapport between the two. Both feel an overwhelming and inexplicable feeling of familiarity and comfort with each other, as if they had belonged together all along and they were suddenly unable to stay apart. As days go by and they continue to spend time together, their feelings for each other only intensify, despite Leah\\'s skepticism and effort to ignore them.

       " '\"Title - John Lennon &amp; The Plastic Ono Band: Live in Toronto \\'69, Description - John Lennon & The Plastic Ono Band Live In Toronto &rsquo;69 is a rare look at one of the world&rsquo;s most influential popular artists at a pivotal moment in his career. Filmed on the eve of the release of the Abbey Road LP &mdash; the last Beatles album to be recorded &mdash; this is the only performance ever caught on film of John Lennon & the Plastic Ono Band. It had been three years since Lennon had performed onstage with The Beatles. Seemingly on a whim, John and wife Yoko Ono hopped on a plane with guitarist Eric Clapton, bassist Klaus Voormann and drummer Alan White to travel to the Toronto Rock &rsquo;N&rsquo; Roll Revival festival showcasing some of Lennon&rsquo;s early musical heroes &mdash; among them Bo Diddley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry and Little Richard. As it turned out, Lennon and the newly formed Plastic Ono Band played an equally significant role that night in the history of rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll, as it is widely believed this concert foreshadowed the official end of The Beatles. Captured by Academy Award&reg;&ndash;nominated director D.A. Pennebaker (The War Room, Don&rsquo;t Look Back, Monterey Pop), this concert film serves as one of the great historical documents in the career and life of John Lennon.\"',\n",
       " '\"Title - The Sergeant, Description - Master Sergeant Albert Callan (Rod Steiger) is one tough G.I. During World War II, he killed an enemy soldier with his bare hands. Now in postwar France, he wrests control of his army post away from an ineffective superior. But another Sergeant Callan lives behind the snarl and the stare: a man overwhelmed by his repressed attraction to a handsome young private (John Phillip Law). In this insightful exploration of homosexuality made in an era of widespread intolerance, Steiger (The Pawnbroker, In the Heat of the Night) gives a stunning performance - one both volcanic and nuanced - that illuminates Callan\\'s tragic, tormenting battle with his true nature.\"',\n",
       " '\"Title - In Celebration, Description - Utilizing the same brilliant cast as In Celebration\\'s original highly acclaimed Royal Court Theater run, director Lindsay Anderson (O Lucky Man, If) re-imagines his stage triumph into a riveting cinematic experience. Anderson grounds David Storye\\'s ferocious and poignant drama in a setting that is as realistic as the playwright\\'s caustic portrait of generational hypocrisy is universal. In their tiny house in a Yorkshire mining town, God-fearing and hard-working Mr. and Mrs. Shaw (Bill Owen and Constance Chapman) welcome their sons home to celebrate the couple\\'s fortieth wedding anniversary. But with each son\\'s arrival, more and more of the Shaw\\'s model blue collar family facade begins to chip away. Middle son Colin\\'s (James Bolam) engagement has placed him on the pat to a loveless marriage. Barely shouldering the burdens of his shattered artistic aspirations and his own family, Steven, the baby, brilliantly played by Brian Cox (Manhunter, 25th Hour), is on the threshold of a nervous breakdown. But the toaster tossed into this already scalding theatrical bath is Alan Bates (Georgy Girl, The Cherry Orchard) as eldest son Andrew. As father, mother and brothers futilely try to hide the truth from themselves and each other, Bates\\' Andrew tears into the Shaw family\\'s carefully maintained fictions with animal fury and all too human bitterness.\"',\n",

Rock n\\' roll may never die, but the Sakuragoaka Girl\\'s High School Light Music Club might not be here to stay unless would-be drummer Ritsu Tainaka can find three more members to replace the graduated seniors. Determined to see that the beat goes on, Ritsu can get a little help from her friend Mio Akiyama on bass, and together they might be able to convince choir-inclined Tsumugi Kotobuki to join on the keyboards. But even then, they\\'ll still need a hero, preferably of the juke-box variety with stars in her eyes. Instead they find Yui Hirasawa, who\\'s looking for a club to join and who\\'s never held a guitar in her life. But when Yui does pick up a beat-up six-string, it feels good in her hands, and it doesn\\'t take long to understand that maybe she\\'s finally found a place where she belongs. Because you can\\'t stop the music when four girls share a dream, even if it\\'s something as crazy as someday playing at the famous Budokan. It\\'s going to be a long and winding road, but if they find their passion and follow their muse, they could go anywhere! Special Features: Clean Opening and Closing.

All that\\'s missing are interesting characters and credible stories. In the future, humans are passive passengers in self-propelled AI cars and trucks. But when a vehicle goes haywire or gets reprogrammed, the teenage eX-Drivers go into action. The tension between brash Lisa and half-pint Souichi continues from the last disc, aggravated by the arrival of motorcyclist-vamp Rei. In the two-part finale, ex-eX-Driver Joe Todo (\"he strayed from the path\") and his gang of punks terrorize the city with their gasoline-powered cars--until Souichi outsmarts them in a race. Joe sees the light and returns to the path of virtue--a conversion no more improbable than the rest of the story.

Noted Hollywood producer Andrew Vajna (Terminator, Rambo, Nixon, Angel Heart) played a major role in overseeing the restoration process.
